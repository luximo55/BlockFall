# About BlockFall
BlockFall is a game I made for my programming class. The game graphics and program were made by me.

# Design
BlockFall has a minimal graphic design reminiscent of old games from the 70s.

# The goal
The goal of the game is to collect as many positive points (blue-colored blocks) compared to negative points (yellow-colored blocks). You have to try and get as high of a percentage of positive points as possible while not losing the game.
